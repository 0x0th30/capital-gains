### Technologies
- NodeJS: a versatile platform for developing efficient solutions.
- Docker: a virtualization platform to streamline code build and execution.

### Paradigm
OOP - Object Oriented Programming, offers solid patterns to build software like this, helps in some processes like [wallet management](../app/src/entities/wallet.ts), buy/sell stocks and other interactions avoiding code repetition.

### Code Structure
The project is organized into three main source folders that house core features:
- `controllers`: to establish a communication interface with the user.
- `entities`: representing essential components in management operations.
- `services`: containing general-purpose classes that execute specific tasks.
